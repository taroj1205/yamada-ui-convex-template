# Convex + Next.js + Convex Auth Template

This repository is a template for building full-stack applications using [Convex](https://convex.dev/) as the backend, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and routing, and [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) for authentication. It is designed to provide a clean, type-safe, and extensible starting point for your own projects.

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- Next.js for optimized web hosting and page routing
- Convex Auth for authentication

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase, run:

```
bun install
bun run dev
```
